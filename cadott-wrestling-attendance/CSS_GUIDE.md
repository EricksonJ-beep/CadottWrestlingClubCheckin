# 🎨 CSS Build & Watch Guide

## ✅ Done: Initial CSS Build

Your CSS has been successfully built! The file `public/styles.css` (5.4MB) is ready to use.

---

## 🔄 Auto-Watch Mode - Two Ways to Run

### Option 1: Using NPM Script (Recommended)
```bash
npm run watch-css
```

### Option 2: Using Shell Script
```bash
./watch-css.sh
```

### Option 3: Direct Command
```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/styles/input.css -o ./public/styles.css --watch
```

---

## 📝 What Watch Mode Does

When running in watch mode:
- ✅ Automatically rebuilds CSS when you save changes to `input.css`
- ✅ Automatically rebuilds CSS when you save changes to `tailwind.config.js`
- ✅ Shows you real-time feedback in the terminal
- ✅ Runs continuously until you stop it (Ctrl+C)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Workflow

### One-Time Build (when you're done editing)
```bash
npm run build-css
```

### Continuous Development (while you're editing)
```bash
npm run watch-css
```
Leave this running in a terminal while you edit your styles.

---

## 📂 Files You'll Edit

- **src/styles/input.css** - Your source CSS (edit this)
- **tailwind.config.js** - Tailwind configuration (colors, etc.)
- **public/styles.css** - Generated output (don't edit this)

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **Keep watch mode running** in a separate terminal while developing
2. **Refresh your browser** after CSS rebuilds to see changes
3. **Stop watch mode** (Ctrl+C) when you're done for the day
4. **Run build-css once** before deploying to production
